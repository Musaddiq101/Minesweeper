Minesweeper: 
Instructions on how to run the game:

The goal of the game is to find the locations of all the bombs

Select the grid size from 4X4 to 10X10

You enter a square's coordinates, such as E4, on each try.

You lose if there's a bomb in that tile. If not, the square will contain the total amount of bombs that are directly surrounding it, including those that are positioned diagonally.

To save you time, if the number is zero, the squares surrounding it will automatically be "opened" since there aren't any bombs there.

If you believe you have located a bomb, enter 'M' and then the square's coordinates, for example, ME4.

By 'opening' every tile except the ones containing bombs, you will win.

Goodluck!
